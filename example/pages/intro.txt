# FlowDoc Demo

FlowDoc is a simple and lightweight tool for creating [style guides](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides) and project documentation. It builds a simple website from a bunch of text files written in markdown format.

This small site demonstrates FlowDoc in action. It shows documentation for the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) buttons and forms in a style guide format.

The FlowDoc source code is available here: https://github.com/mwilkosinski/flowdoc. The source code of this demo site is located in the `example` subdirecotry.


## How to use FlowDoc

The easiest way to start is to make a copy of the `example` folder, then:

1. Add your markdown files to the `pages` directory
2. Edit the file `config.json` adding the file name and a title for each of your markdown files (the title will appear in the navigation menu).

Please note, FlowDoc must be served from a HTTP server, it will _NOT_ work locally opened as `file:///...`

## Under the bonnet

For those interested in the inner workings of FlowDoc, it's been written in [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for modular architecture.
