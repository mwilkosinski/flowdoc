# FlowDoc

FlowDoc is a simple documentation framework. It builds a simple website from a bunch of text files written in markdown format. Use FlowDoc to:

* Create documentation for projects
* Create living style guides for your CSS

## How to use

1. Add your markdown files to the `content` directory
2. Edit the file `content/config.json` adding the file name and a title for each of your markdown files (the title will appear in the navigation menu).

Please note, FlowDoc will must be served from a HTTP server, it will _NOT_ work locally opened as `file:///...`.
